# my_first_flutter

After deciding to take my first steps into Flutter (Dart) development, and after reading a few documents and watching some YouTube tutorials, this was my very first experience coding with Dart and Flutter.

What you will se here is the result of me following Google's Flutter Codelab ["Your first Flutter app"](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-codelab-first#8). (with some extra touch-ups)

## Getting Started
1. `flutter pub get` (to install dependencies)
2. `flutter run` to run the app or use your IDE "Run & Debug" controls.

<sub>(considering you've all the [requirements of a flutter environment](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) fulfilled/installed)</sub>
